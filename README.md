# Web Dev Starter Code

## Overview

This project was a practice in taking a mockup or example site and re-creating it 
using html, css, and javascript. We recreated the Lorem Ipsum site with headers, 
footers, company logo, sign off and more.

## How to Run
1. Clone this git repository containing this project
2. Open the cloned directory in VS Code
3. Open the command pallette in VS Code
4. Run the command: "Live Preview: Start Server"
5. Play with the radio buttons at the bottom and enjoy! (In order to see the alert,
you need to view the site in an external browser)
